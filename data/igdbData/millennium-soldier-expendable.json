The remake of the game for Android based devices was released in late 2012 as Expendable: Rearmed. It is in the format of a modern arcade game. The player starts with 7 \"credits\" and can continue until running out of credits. A second player can join the game at any time by pressing start. \n \nLike most top-down run and gun video games, it has collectible upgrades and weapons, and features common aspects like bosses and levels, familiar with most games of this type. \n \nMillennium Soldier: Expendable supports Environment-Mapped Bump Mapping, a DirectX 6 feature first supported by the Matrox Millennium G400.[1]",
