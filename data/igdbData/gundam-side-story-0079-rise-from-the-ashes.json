    "summary": "Step into the giant, mechanized suit of the Gundam. There, across battlefields of a war-beaten Earth, you\u0027ll command your forces against units of the Zeon army. You\u0027ll need to master every move in your suit--and weapon in your arsenal--to outflank the Zeon and complete each mission. And although you\u0027ve got armored vehicles and ant-sized infantry on your side, the battle will be lost or won by your ability to jump, hover, and fly into battle while zooming in your weapons on the enemy. \nA cross between first-person shooter and strategy game, Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise From the Ashes comes from a series that originated on the Sega Saturn. This title features such enhancements as detailed 3-D mobile suits, cinematic interstitial scenes, a dramatic soundtrack, and actual sound effects from the anime TV series, Gundam Wing."
