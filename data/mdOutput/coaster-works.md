summary: "Move over tycoons, the baddest coaster in the land is coming straight for the SEGA Dreamcast. Coaster Works serves up much more than your typical roller coaster game. Build your own death defying tracks, or trade them on-line with friends. No matter how you play, hold on, because Coaster Works will be the most intense ride of your life. 
Ride your own tracks 
 
No other roller coaster simulation lets you actually ride the tracks you have created. Coaster Works lets you climb into the hot seat for all the razor-sharp turns, daredevil drops, and stomach-churning loops you can dish out. You can playback the action from multiple viewpoints as well, giving your coaster a whole new life. 
 
The Killer G's are back! 
 
Advancing to the next level isn't as simple as building a cool track. Your creations are tested under conditions like top speed, safety level, and of course, how many G's they can pull! Not enough force? How about slipping in some serious drops followed by a killer corkscrew. Watch out for your safety level though, because too much force and you'll derail your coaster!"
