summary: "Step into the giant, mechanized suit of the Gundam. There, across battlefields of a war-beaten Earth, you'll command your forces against units of the Zeon army. You'll need to master every move in your suit--and weapon in your arsenal--to outflank the Zeon and complete each mission. And although you've got armored vehicles and ant-sized infantry on your side, the battle will be lost or won by your ability to jump, hover, and fly into battle while zooming in your weapons on the enemy. 
A cross between first-person shooter and strategy game, Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise From the Ashes comes from a series that originated on the Sega Saturn. This title features such enhancements as detailed 3-D mobile suits, cinematic interstitial scenes, a dramatic soundtrack, and actual sound effects from the anime TV series, Gundam Wing."
