The game features 3 levels of difficulty. There are also four Assist functions - Stability Control for cornering, Traction Control from the engine to the tires, Anti Lock Brake System to keep the tires from locking during braking and Intelligent Brake System for braking before corners so beginners can concentrate on steering.
