summary: "Maken X is a game for the Dreamcast video game console that fits into an subgenre of &quote;first-person slashers&quote;. The game is mainly regarded as a first-person action game because of the realistic elements in gameplay. It is unique in that the main character is the weapon (Maken), rather than a person. 
 
The word &quote;Maken&quote; literally translates as &quote;demonic sword&quote;. On the title screen, the &quote;X&quote; is shown to stand for deus ex machina (Latin for &quote;god out of the machine&quote;). 
 
The player can control a number of characters via &quote;brainjacking&quote;, which leaves the person a vegetable. The woman displayed on the boxart is the first person controlled when the facility that Maken was created at comes under attack."
