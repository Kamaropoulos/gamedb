The good elves tried everything they could to rid their garden of these bugs. But nothing worked. \n\nOne day, an elf named Oliver was hacking away at a poisoned mushroom in the garden. Suddenly, he saw an unusual stick gleaming in the dirt. Just as Oliver picked up the stick, a spider jumped out from behind a mushroom and rushed at him. When Oliver waved his hands wildly to try to scare the spider away, sparks flew from his stick and the spider disappeared! \n\n&quote;How did that happen?&quote; Oliver wondered out loud. &quote;Could this be a magic wand?&quote; \n\nSoon Oliver had another chance to try the wand. When the scorpion scurried across a row of mushroom, poisoning every mushroom it touched, Oliver pointed the wand at the scorpion and shouted, &quote;Be gone!&quote; Instantly, the scorpion disappeared and the poisoned mushrooms were transformed back into normal mushrooms. \n\n&quote;This is great! This is the tool we need to clean up our mushroom garden&quote; Oliver shouted ecstatically. \n\nWith his new found magic wand, Oliver hid behind a mushroom. &quote;OK, you great big Centipede,&quote; he said. &quote;Come out wherever you are.

After being jolted awake by a tone over the airplane's PA system and a friendly conversation with a fellow passenger named David, a group of terrorists, who seem to be guided by some kind of mysterious cultist chanting to himself, suddenly and violently takes control of the plane. David, who turns out to be a special agent within the FBI, attempts to stop the terrorists, but he is thwarted when a meteorite strikes the plane, sending it crashing into the Canadian wilderness. After a series of bad dreams, Laura awakens in a small cabin being cared for by Kimberly Fox, a poet and songwriter who also survived the crash. She explains that ten days have passed since the accident, although Kimberly had only found her some distance from the crash site two days prior, leaving a strange eight-day gap where she was mysteriously taken care of. The moment of peace is broken when another survivor, one of the hijackers, staggers into the cabin before suddenly transforming into a hideous plant-like monster. Here, Laura and Kimberly meet Parker Jackson, a CETI researcher and fellow crash survivor who drives out the monster, only to be driven out himself by a distrusting Kimberly. \nLaura then sets out into the wilderness in order to investigate the possibility of contacting the outside world and seeking out other survivors only to discover that more strange, hideous creatures are lurking in the area, as something is causing the crash survivors to mutate into the very same monsters she must avoid and battle while travelling through the region. She is driven deeper into the mystery when she must venture into an abandoned mining facility in order to locate Jannie, a lost little girl Kimberly had found along with Laura and one of the plane's former passengers.",summary:"A survival horror video game developed by WARP for the Dreamcast.

Other developers and publishers have since been brought in for spin-off titles and sequels[1] \nThe Spec Ops franchise was intended to introduce a realistic first/third-person shooter experience and immerse the player in a two-man team gameplay. The first two games were well received; and the PlayStation and Dreamcast sequels, developed by Runecraft, received lower review scores.[2] The latest game in the series, Spec Ops: The Line, was highly acclaimed for its narrative, based on the novel Heart of Darkness."},null]},"310c":function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"floigan-bros-episode-1",title:"Floigan Bros. - Episode 1","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"6093",region:"EU",version:"1.002",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"},{id:"50F0",region:"US",version:"1.001",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"6093 GD-ROM1/1 EU",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"habaOyRreyQ",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"},{fingerprint:"50F0 GD-ROM1/1 US",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"sJJ2Khg2xwc",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:0},null]},3160:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"capcom-vs-snk-millennium-fight-2000-pro",title:"Capcom vs. SNK - Millennium Fight 2000 Pro","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"360E",region:"JP",version:"1.001",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"360E GD-ROM1/1 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"Gb57uLc9uqw",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:45829,cover:[{id:69975,alpha_channel:!1,animated:!1,game:45829,height:1194,image_id:"co1hzr",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1hzr.jpg",width:850}],first_release_date:978220800,categories:["Fighting"],name:"Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro",popularity:1.840157565682484,slug:"capcom-vs-snk-millennium-fight-2000-pro",summary:"Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 is a 2000 head-to-head fighting game produced by Capcom originally released as a coin-operated arcade game for Sega '​s NAOMI hardware and later ported to the Dreamcast.

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles. \nLike Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris &quote;The Bear&quote; Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want. \nThroughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word &quote;RUMBLE&quote; is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called &quote;Rumble Flurry&quote;, which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold. \nOne unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game"},null]},"44c2":function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"jojo-s-bizarre-adventure",title:"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"2BBC",region:"EU",version:"1.001",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"},{id:"3549",region:"JP",version:"1.001",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"2BBC GD-ROM1/1 EU",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"avaxeoBL8Nk",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"},{fingerprint:"3549 GD-ROM1/1 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"VC_JH4iuUmc",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:0},null]},"44f0":function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"king-of-fighters-2001",title:"King of Fighters 2001, The","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"3559",region:"JP",version:"1.006",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"3559 GD-ROM1/1 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"bhY8f1p70S0",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:0},null]},4597:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"first-kiss-story",title:"First Kiss Story","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"0EBC",region:"JP",version:"1.002",discs:2,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"0EBC GD-ROM2/2 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"o7TFe9t_FLk",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"},{fingerprint:"0EBC GD-ROM1/2 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"xDEZEBOTwWU",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:0},null]},4620:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"elysion-eien-no-sanctuary",title:"Elysion - Eien no Sanctuary","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"8A57",region:"JP",version:"1.005",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"8A57 GD-ROM1/1 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"amIYUvlrDEM",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:77756,cover:[{id:60099,game:77756,height:329,image_id:"e03iirf3bmnxkyvnfwoo",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e03iirf3bmnxkyvnfwoo.jpg",width:256}],tags:["anime","eroge"],name:"Elysion: Eien no Sanctuary",popularity:1,slug:"elysion-eien-no-sanctuary",summary:"A visual novel from Terios."},null]},"463a":function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"nba-hoopz",title:"NBA Hoopz","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"B073",region:"EU",version:"1.000",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"B073 GD-ROM1/1 EU",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"wkZdowiiDxc",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:10634,age_ratings:[{id:6835,rating:8},{id:6836,rating:1}],cover:[{id:10304,game:10634,height:320,image_id:"gs5wpud4vvdv7pv1grwb",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gs5wpud4vvdv7pv1grwb.jpg",width:256}],first_release_date:981936e3,game_modes:["Single player","Multiplayer"],categories:["Sport"],tags:["basketball","sports","jump","referees","skill points","national basketball association","sports jersey","basketball hoop","indiana pacers","los angeles lakers","sneakers"],name:"NBA Hoopz",player_perspectives:["Side view"],popularity:1,slug:"nba-hoopz",summary:"Get ready for some seriously hot hoops action in the three-on-three court competition of NBA HOOPZ from Midway.

As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods). \nYou can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster. \nUse the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies.

Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir. \nEventually, Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' flying Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth.

You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets.

The Ancient Echidna Tribe's ruler, Pachacamac, plans for world domination. His daughter Tikal enters a shrine, discovering the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald, a group of mysterious emeralds with unlimited power. She befriends a peaceful entity known as Chaos, the guardian of the emeralds, as well as the Chao. Despite warnings from Tikal, Pachacamac and the tribe attack the shrine, attempting to use the emeralds for their own gain. However, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos and kills them. Following Chaos' attack, Tikal seals the entity and herself inside the Master Emerald. \nThree thousand years later, Knuckles the Echidna guards the Master Emerald on the floating Angel Island when the evil scientist Doctor Ivo &quote;Eggman&quote; Robotnik shatters the Master Emerald and sets Chaos free. As a result, Angel Island plunges into the sea, causing the Master Emerald's shards and the seven Chaos Emeralds to be scattered. Resolving to search for the shards of the Master Emerald, Knuckles sets off. In the city of Station Square, Sonic the Hedgehog battles Chaos after witnessing an attack by the police. Miles &quote;Tails&quote; Prower tests his Chaos Emerald-powered airplane, only to crash on the beach of Emerald Coast. After Sonic rescues Tails, they go to his workshop in the Mystic Ruins, where they are confronted by Eggman. The mad scientist uses Tails' Emerald to transform Chaos and he reveals his ultimate plan: with the power harnessed from the Emeralds, Chaos will eventually become invincible and destroy Station Square and Eggman will build Robotnikland over the city's ruins. Sonic and Tails resolve to search for the emeralds to prevent Eggman from getting them first, but eventually lose the ones they find to Eggman and Chaos. Eggman escapes in his airship, the Egg Carrier, and shoots down Sonic and Tails' pursuing plane. \nEggman activates E-102 Gamma and fights E-101 Beta during his training. He orders the rest of the E-Series robots to search for Froggy, a frog who has eaten Chaos's tail as well as a Chaos Emerald. Gamma finds Froggy but is chased back to the ship by Froggy's owner Big the Cat. After his crash, Tails finds another emerald and uses it to prepare the Tornado II plane to find Sonic while Sonic lands in Station Square once again. While lamenting her time with Sonic, Amy Rose discovers a Flicky bird in possession of a Chaos Emerald and names him Birdie. However, Eggman, having discovered Birdie's location, dispatches his robot Zero to chase the Flicky down. After Sonic turns down an offer to protect Birdie, Zero captures Amy and Birdie and detains them both on the Egg Carrier, with Sonic and Tails using the Tornado II to follow them on board. Knuckles also boards the aircraft after collecting pieces of the Master Emerald and seeing an image of the Egg Carrier in the emerald. \nOn board the Egg Carrier, Eggman calls out the E-Series robots for their failure and removes them before stationing Gamma in Amy's cell. However, Gamma witnesses Beta being rebuilt and Amy convinces Gamma that he should not work for Eggman, as he is an enemy. In a confusion of newly discovered emotions, Gamma releases Amy and Birdie. While being chased by Zero, Amy goes to the ship's deck. She meets up with Sonic and Tails, but Eggman appears and steals Birdie's emerald, dispatching Gamma to attack Sonic. Sonic damages Gamma, but Amy intervenes and asks Sonic to spares him. Gamma, understanding that Eggman is an enemy, decides to follow the others. The ship loses altitude and Tails, Amy, and Gamma flee, while Sonic restores the ship to its original form. Sonic is confronted by Chaos, now with six Chaos Emeralds and his tail restored, and defeats it once more before pursuing Eggman. Meanwhile, Big retrieves Froggy from inside Chaos before finding the Tornado II, and Knuckles steals back the six Chaos Emeralds; they both flee from the ship as it crashes. \nUpon erasing his master registration, Gamma resolves to track down his brother robots. After freeing the animals inside the robots, he goes to the Egg Carrier and confronts Beta, in his rebuilt form. Gamma defeats him, but the fight also causes Gamma to be destroyed, with Birdie's parents being released from within the two. Returning to the Egg Carrier, Amy reunites Birdie with its family, but she is confronted by Zero after he knocks down the Flicky. Amy defeats the robot and sees Birdie and his family off, vowing to do her best. Elsewhere, Tails chases Eggman and stops him from detonating a missile in the middle of Station Square. Eggman resorts to using the Egg Walker to try and level the city, but is again defeated by Tails. Later, Sonic confronts the mad scientist in his Egg Viper and destroys it. \nA day following Eggman's defeats, Knuckles restores the shards of the Master Emerald, but Angel Island collapses into the sea once again when Chaos attacks him and Eggman. Chaos absorbs the 6 Chaos Emeralds and locates the seventh aboard the Tornado II, which crashed after Big used it to escape the Egg Carrier. With all the Chaos Emeralds, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, draining the Chaos Emeralds of their negative energy, and destroys Station Square in a massive flood. The Chaos Emeralds are re-gathered by Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big, and the pink Flicky that fueled Gamma. They bring the emeralds to Sonic. \nTikal appears, having taken each main character into the past numerous times beforehand, demanding that Chaos must be sealed back in the Master Emerald. Sonic objects, saying that Chaos's heart would still be filled with anger and sadness if he were to be sealed inside the Master Emerald. Instead, with the cheering of his friends and the people of Station Square, Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds' still-present positive energy to become Super Sonic and face off against Perfect Chaos. Following his defeat, Chaos discovers that the Chao thrive in Station Square, quelling his anger. United with Tikal, Chaos ascends into the heavens and disappears.

Each of the three characters retain many of their trademark moves from previous Sonic games, such as Tails being able to fly for short periods of time, and Knuckles being able to glide through the air, though they can use updated techniques as well. The rest of the playable cast is rounded out by Amy, who must use her hammer to escape from Eggman's E-100 Zero robot chasing after her, Gamma, who must use its laser beam to shoot through levels to reach a target, and Big, who fishes in efforts to find his friend, Froggy. \nThe &quote;Adventure Mode&quote; is a one-player game which consists of two areas, the &quote;Adventure Field&quote; and an &quote;Action Stage&quote;.

Chao can be taken with the player by downloading the minigame Chao Adventure to their VMU, or in the GameCube version, a Game Boy Advance with Sonic Advance or various other Game Boy Advance Sonic games. The player can also raise their stats by giving them small animals that they found by defeating the robots, which improves their performance in Chao Races. There are also eggs hidden throughout the Adventure Fields which can produce special types of Chao. \nBy playing through Action Stages and Subgames, searching through the Adventure Fields or winning Chao Races, players can earn Emblems. In the case of Action Stages, each one has three Emblems, which can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling certain objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.",videos:[{id:3811,game:7860,name:"Game intro",video_id:"lO6Tc2xaAwE"},{id:3812,game:7860,name:"Gameplay video",video_id:"A2wzZt9SVuA"},{id:17862,game:7860,name:"Gameplay video",video_id:"bo45qMv2HAg"}]},null]},8746:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"walt-disney-world-quest-magical-racing-tour",title:"Walt Disney World Quest - Magical Racing Tour","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"DE69",region:"EU",version:"1.000",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"DE69 GD-ROM1/1 EU",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"3K0YZ5mIXlk",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:8129,age_ratings:[{id:5084,rating:8}],aggregated_rating:80,aggregated_rating_count:2,cover:[{id:8576,game:8129,height:254,image_id:"g0mgn5hgbsul5txlu9hx",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g0mgn5hgbsul5txlu9hx.jpg",width:256}],first_release_date:953769600,game_modes:["Single player","Multiplayer","Split screen"],categories:["Racing"],tags:["vehicular combat","go-kart","disney","roller coaster","kid friendly","talking animals","vehicle combat","licensed game","driving/racing","adapted from television","cartoon character","games based on movies","game over","laps","cornering","kart racer","chipmunk"],name:"Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour",player_perspectives:["Third person"],popularity:1.849756597345666,slug:"walt-disney-world-quest-magical-racing-tour",summary:"Walt Disney World Quest Magical Racing Tour boasts more playable characters than any kart racer before it (a total of 13 are offered), and each of the game's tracks allows you to maneuver a different vehicle.

The Secret Operation Raid Team (SORT) has sent an agent, Tom, to investigate a research facility. During the recon mission, he learns that Dr. Edward Kirk, a world-renowned scientist who was reported dead three years ago, is leading a secret weapons project within the facility. SORT sends four agents (Regina, Gail, Rick, and Cooper) to acquire Kirk and return him to custody. The team arrives on the island under cover of darkness, dropping in via parachute. Cooper is blown off course and lands in the jungle away from the others. Lost in the dark, he is chased down by a Tyrannosaurus rex and eaten. The other three agents, unaware of his death, proceed with the mission.\nOnce inside the base, they discover the eviscerated and partially devoured corpses of security personnel and scientists. After splitting up to restore power to the facility, Gail goes missing. Whilst searching for him, Regina is confronted by a Velociraptor. Re-uniting with Rick, the two determine it was the dinosaurs that caused the bloodbath at the base. Although their mission to recover Dr. Kirk still stands, it is now more important to signal for a rescue. Regina sets out to activate the main antenna to contact their airlift. On her way, she is attacked by another Velociraptor and is rescued by Gail, who then leaves to continue searching for Dr. Kirk. After restoring communications, Regina heads back to the control room and they receive a signal on their communicators. Believing it might be Cooper or Tom in trouble, Rick wants to investigate. Gail shoots down the idea, wanting to follow up on a CCTV sighting that might have been Kirk. The player must choose which course of action to follow.\nIf the player follows Rick, they come across Tom, badly injured and near death. Rick takes him to the medical room, however a Velociraptor attacks them, and Tom sacrifices himself to kill it, saving Rick. Later, Regina and the team manage to locate Kirk and apprehend him. As they are preparing to leave via helicopter, the T. rex returns and destroys the helicopter, forcing them to flee back into the base while Kirk manages to escape. Regina and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft, but find a vortex in the way of getting to it. Rick speculates this is the space time distortion that brought the dinosaurs back. The two split up to find an alternate route off the island, and Regina ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk. He is about to kill her when the gun is shot out of his hand by Gail, and they arrest him again.\nKirk reveals that the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an experiment he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should cancel each other out if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick. The story then takes one of three endings.",summary:"Dino Crisis is a survival horror video game developed and produced by Capcom originally for the Sony PlayStation console in 1999. It was developed by the same team behind Capcom's Resident Evil, including director Shinji Mikami, and shares many similarities with the Resident Evil games that preceded it, but is more action-oriented.\nThe story follows Regina, a red-headed special operations agent who is part of a team sent to investigate a mysterious island facility. Finding the place overrun with vicious dinosaurs, Regina must fight through the Velociraptor-filled facility to discover what happened and ultimately escape alive. The game mixes exploration and puzzle-based gameplay with traditional survival horror mechanics.\nThere are multiple endings based on player choices and actions.",videos:[{id:4636,game:3027,name:"Trailer",video_id:"ui7ii96Pz3E"},{id:4637,game:3027,name:"Game intro",video_id:"zTCYSSZKJRE"}]},null]},a332:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"pod-2-multiplayer-online",title:"POD 2 - Multiplayer Online","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"2CA6",region:"EU",version:"1.004",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"2CA6 GD-ROM1/1 EU",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"qfEFQiEsNLY",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:0},null]},a35d:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"silver",title:"Silver","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"027A",region:"EU",version:"1.001",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"},{id:"4EF2",region:"US",version:"1.001",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"027A GD-ROM1/1 EU",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"pjVza8WunjM",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"},{fingerprint:"4EF2 GD-ROM1/1 US",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"N94a9yIw07I",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:7042,age_ratings:[{id:5823,rating:10}],cover:[{id:7214,game:7042,height:763,image_id:"witylijpse9gmtg0hwqq",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/witylijpse9gmtg0hwqq.jpg",width:600}],first_release_date:921801600,game_modes:["Single player"],categories:["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],tags:["arpg - action rpg","fantasy","rpg","role playing","adventure","crime","text-based","text adventure"],name:"Silver",player_perspectives:["Bird view"],popularity:2.484967017124273,screenshots:[{id:43754,game:7042,height:1080,image_id:"dngiezzaod5yzxrzcatc",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dngiezzaod5yzxrzcatc.jpg",width:1920},{id:43755,game:7042,height:1080,image_id:"p6aywdg6fcpxgdvnht5g",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p6aywdg6fcpxgdvnht5g.jpg",width:1920},{id:43756,game:7042,height:1080,image_id:"h33tu0p5qa6ct5mps4su",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h33tu0p5qa6ct5mps4su.jpg",width:1920},{id:43757,game:7042,height:1080,image_id:"yh0f1juxhrmz0bylyfog",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yh0f1juxhrmz0bylyfog.jpg",width:1920},{id:43758,game:7042,height:1080,image_id:"mdadj9sipgdvbalu4vn2",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mdadj9sipgdvbalu4vn2.jpg",width:1920}],slug:"silver",summary:"An RPG set in a medieval land where all the women have been kidnapped and it is up to you to get them back.

During excavation, an egg-shaped mecha was found inside the ruins containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied. \nUpon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old.

Unfortunately, a lack of features, shoddy audio presentation, and major gameplay flaws meant that WSB2K1 was not well received by critics despite its fantastic graphics. The game is notorious for its sometimes-unresponsive controls, as well as the fact that manual fielding—a staple of baseball games for a half-decade prior to WSB2K1's release—isn't even an option available to players.[citation needed] \nAfter the debacle that was World Series Baseball 2K1, Sega decided to bring Visual Concepts (the developer behind the Dreamcast's far more successful NBA 2K and NFL 2K series) in for the next version of the game.

Power Stone 2 allows up to four players to choose from multiple characters and utilize items such as tables, chairs, and rocks in battle.\n\nThere are four different modes available for the game\n1-on-1: Much like the original Power Stone, a two-character storyline game. Arcade: A four-character storyline game, with two characters advancing each round. Original: Multiplayer mode, with free choice of characters and stages. Adventure: An unpredictable storyline game, where players can collect items, cards and money. Power Stone 2 offers five interactive 3-D stages to begin with, plus the two boss stages which players can also access in Original mode. All but the Original mode is played out like a storyline, where two battles are fought on the regular stages, followed by the Pharaoh Walker boss, then another battle, and ending with the Dr. Erode boss stage. Three extra stages may be unlocked for Original mode by meeting certain requirements in Arcade mode, as well as a desert area stage, which is essentially the Pharaoh Walker boss stage, but without the boss. Though each player has their own set of default ground and air attacks, the character can execute more powerful fusion attacks after collecting three Power Stones and transforming. Power Stone 2 does not offer an opportunity to block, although tapping on the control pad just before an enemy attacks will cause you to dodge.\nMost of the stages are dynamic and will change as the battle progresses. For example, the airplane stage starts out on a warplane. After a set amount of time, the plane will fall apart, forcing all the players to battle while skydiving toward the ground. Shortly after, the players will fall onto a floating platform, where the remainder of the battle will be held. This, in essence, creates three sub-stages within a single one.\nEach stage is also littered with item boxes, which hold a random item that a player has acquired and unlocked in Adventure mode or created in the Item Shop. They may also contain Power Stones. Items are extremely diverse. Damaging items range from guns, flamethrowers, gigantic hammers, a wide assortment of swords, to bear traps, roller blades, and even a magazine that can be thrown. Non-damaging items include food that will replenish health, shields for defense, elixirs for invisibility, adhesive sprays to slow your opponents, and wings for extra jumps. Cards that can be used to mix items can also be found in Adventure mode. Furthermore, most stages also have their own collection of unique items and fixtures that the player can use. For example, the submarine level comes with turrets, small planes to drop bombs, and icebergs to throw at opponents. Each level is also highly interactive, as players can use many of the stage elements themselves. All players can also gain extra height by jumping off a wall.",videos:[{id:5613,game:13106,name:"Gameplay video",video_id:"X7-b0Jve_jY"},{id:5614,game:13106,name:"Trailer",video_id:"mcft74HS_Ks"}]},null]},c251:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"wild-metal",title:"Wild Metal","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"2AD3",region:"EU",version:"1.003",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"},{id:"5BF0",region:"US",version:"1.003",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"2AD3 GD-ROM1/1 EU",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"g_puL6gxIUY",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"},{fingerprint:"5BF0 GD-ROM1/1 US",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"0HDxOSyxhn0",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:80092,age_ratings:[{id:20209,rating:10}],cover:[{id:56211,game:80092,height:640,image_id:"x0iy4maaoxbk7i82q9av",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x0iy4maaoxbk7i82q9av.jpg",width:640}],categories:["Strategy"],tags:["vehicular combat","freeware","car","vehicle combat","strategy","machine gun","digital distribution","crate","explosives","gun"],name:"Wild Metal",popularity:1,slug:"wild-metal",summary:"Wild Metal is a 3D strategic vehicular combat game set in a distant land, in which you command armed roving vehicles to disrupt dangerous automated military units that have overtaken the Tehric planetary system."},null]},c2c9:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"king-of-fighters-2000",title:"King of Fighters 2000, The","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"4C41",region:"JP",version:"1.003",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"4C41 GD-ROM1/1 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"Mh3U-nOjUH0",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:0},null]},c2d2:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"ecw-anarchy-rulz",title:"ECW Anarchy Rulz","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"7AB8",region:"EU",version:"1.003",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"7AB8 GD-ROM1/1 EU",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"P-Ny9i5WhZc",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:72029,age_ratings:[{id:19193,rating:10}],cover:[{id:53471,game:72029,height:377,image_id:"kttxv9c3loirvq6dczqs",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kttxv9c3loirvq6dczqs.jpg",width:326}],categories:["Sport"],tags:["blood","wrestling","trash can","mask","cover athlete","professional wrestler","professional wrestling ring","character select screen","ladder","fist","loading screens","table","tag teaming","character creation","difficulty level","2&quote; x 4''","e3 2000","fire extinguisher","finishing move","taunting","piledriver","anarchism","steel chair","crude renditions of real people"],name:"ECW Anarchy Rulz",popularity:1,slug:"ecw-anarchy-rulz",summary:"Acclaim brings its third wrestling title to the Dreamcast with ECW: Anarchy Rulz.

It was released for the Sega Dreamcast in March 2006. The game takes place in an alternate reality based on World War II, and, in a controversial twist, players control German-speaking characters (under the banner of &quote;the Empire&quote;), fighting against enemies (&quote;the Union&quote;) that speak English and possess weapons patterned after those of both real-life Allied and Axis powers (for example, naval units in Level 2 bear heavy resemblance toward the Imperial Japanese warships). The game was released very late in the life of the Dreamcast, but sold much better than expected, probably because there were no other home ports planned in the foreseeable future. \nPlayers assume control of a helicopter, which can be rotated like a more limited version of the mechanism in Zero Gunner 2. Gameplay is largely very traditional, and bears a strong resemblance to some older Toaplan games, especially Twin Cobra. It uses 3D graphics, and a slightly angled perspective to give the game more depth than most other titles in the genre. \nOn October 27, 2011, G.rev announced a remake titled Under Defeat HD to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[1] The game is released by Rising Star Games on February 23, 2012 in Japan, November 9, 2012 in the UK and set to be released on November 28, 2012 in North America for PlayStation 3 only and January 25, 2013 in Europe. The Xbox 360 version for North America was released on August 26, 2014 as a downloadable game-only under Games on Demand. An upgraded version of Under Defeat HD (PS3, Xbox 360) was made on Sega Ring Edge 2 arcade System, named Under Defeat HD+. Now that version is coming to arcades with some improvements via Sega’s ALL.NET. Among the enhancements this will have is a horizontal orientation mode, more detail in the battlefield and a “New Order” mode where apparently you can choose from different types of aircraft."},null]},d23c:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"love-hina-totsuzen-no-engeji-happening",title:"Love Hina - Totsuzen no Engeji Happening","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"978F",region:"JP",version:"1.006",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"978F GD-ROM1/1 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"WS-kvsZ2JIc",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:46375,cover:[{id:50533,game:46375,height:640,image_id:"mo6dv2st7vgbtts1orhg",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mo6dv2st7vgbtts1orhg.jpg",width:640}],first_release_date:972691200,categories:["Adventure"],tags:["anime","harem","games based on anime","licensed game","love triangle","tsundere","naru punch"],name:"Love Hina: Totsuzen no Engeji Happening",popularity:1,slug:"love-hina-totsuzen-no-engeji-happening",summary:"There is a new girl in the Hinata Sou.

Batsu Ichimonji, Hinata Wakaba, Kyosuke Kagami, and the rest of the fighters had resumed their normal school lives and that all of them had enjoyed the calm peace that came after their last adventure, but the peace itself doesn't last for long and that the fighters would soon find themselves getting involved in a new struggle.\nKurow Kirishima: a cold-hearted and ruthless ninja assassin from a mysterious group known only as the &quote;Reverse Society&quote; has his sight set on the Imawano family and plans to eliminate them and their allies so that he can prepare for the advancement of his own ambition to rule Japan. To this end, he attacks Raizo Imawano: the principal of Justice High and father to Batsu, so that he can easily put him out of commission and not have any interference come from him. Secondly, he sends both his older sister Yurika Kirishima and his loyal subordinate Momo Karuizawa into the ranks of the fighters so that the two of them can cause tension and distrust to occur between the friends. His third plot involves brainwashing Gedo gang leader Daigo Kazama so that he can order him into forcing his gang to attack various schools in order to cause even more tension to occur. Lastly, Kurow himself plans to destroy Batsu's reputation by disguising himself as Batsu's doppelganger (named Vatsu) so that he can attack the fighters and make them believe that Batsu is behind it.\nBatsu and his friends must fight back against the evil plot of Kurow and attempt to not let their friendship get destroyed by the conspiracy of a deadly ninja assassin.",summary:"Project Justice is the sequel to Rival Schools: United By Fate.\nProject Justice's fighting system is lifted from the original Rival Schools, with some notable changes. The game continues to be a team fighter, but has teams of three characters instead of two. This allows another Team-Up attack to be used in a fight, but also adds a new type of attack, the Party-Up, initiated by pressing any three attack buttons. The Party-Up is a three-person attack that varies based on what school the character initiating the attack is from.\nThe additional partner also allows players to cancel an opponent's Team-Up Special by inputting a Team-Up command of their own. This initiates a short fighting sequence between one character from each team. If the person initiating the sequence gets the first successful hit in during the sequence before time runs out, the Team-Up they are caught in will be canceled, and the game switches back to the main fight; if the opposing player gets the first hit or time runs out, the Team-Up continues as usual.\nAdditionally, the 'vigor' meter in Project Justice is limited to 5 levels (down from 9 in Rival Schools), with Party-Ups requiring all 5 levels, Team-Ups continuing to cost two levels, and any attempts (successful or not) to cancel a Team-Up costing one level.\nAlso carrying over from the first game, the Dreamcast port of Project Justice in Japan includes a character creation mode that allows a player to create their own fighters who can be used in all modes except for single-player. However, the character creation in Project Justice is packaged as a board game, taking place during an inter-school festival, rather than a date sim game like in Rival Schools. As with School Life Mode in the original Rival Schools, though, this boardgame is not included in non-Japanese ports of Project Justice due to the amount of time it would take to translate the mode. Instead, several unlockable sub-characters were included in these ports, built from the character creation parts in the Japanese version.",videos:[{id:5601,game:13096,name:"Trailer",video_id:"IM1Jd0J9boc"}]},null]},e6de:function(e){e.exports=[{view:"game",layout:"game",author:"reicast",created_at:"2018-03-25 09:00",updated_at:"2019-05-02 09:00",id:"frame-gride",title:"Frame Gride","gamedb-issue":0,releases:[{id:"4F91",region:"JP",version:"4.000",discs:1,medium:"gdrom"}],"test-videos":[{fingerprint:"4F91 GD-ROM1/1 JP",title:"Intro auto run",hw:"i7 2720qm, GeForce 540M",yt:"tpFl4ChNoJs",git:"d59197f84353d7d2b746383e9277d9ed7c8c4053",platform:"win86-release"}],gotIGDBGame:1,idIGDB:10908,cover:[{id:10364,game:10908,height:640,image_id:"ti1upyw1gkpr3jtot8x9",url:"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ti1upyw1gkpr3jtot8x9.jpg",width:640}],first_release_date:931996800,game_modes:["Single player","Multiplayer","Split screen"],categories:["Fighting","Shooter","Simulator"],tags:["battlemech","vehicular combat","fighting","medieval","mech","fantasy","mech combat","futuristic","sci-fi","shooter","online","vehicle combat"],name:"Frame Gride",player_perspectives:["Third person"],popularity:1.421821754560315,slug:"frame-gride",summary:"From Software's attempt to create a fantasy-themed take on Armored Core.
