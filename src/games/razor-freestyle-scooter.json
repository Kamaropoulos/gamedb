    "summary": "Razor Freestyle Scooter is an extreme-sports style action game modeled around small, nimble scooters. In contrast to most games of this type, there is a story. A crazed giant robot has kidnapped your skating buddies. By completing skating challenges at the robot's sky fortress, you must rescue your friends. You skate around 3 large areas and attempt to perform wild tricks, collect scooter wheels and earn bonus time. By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new skater to control."
